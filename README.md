## Audience

**Padma**, 28, has been using Python and Pandas for the last four years to analyze agricultural production in southeast Asia.
She has just completed her PhD and accepted a job with a development bank whose staff use R instead.
Padma wants learn how do the things she has been doing in Python:
read data, clean it, explore it, model it, and present it.

**Dafydd**, 37, has been building performance dashboards for a logistics company using Django and D3.
The company has just hired some data scientists who use R,
and Dafydd would like to try building some dashboards in Shiny.
He doesn't need to know much about statistics---the analysts will take care of that---but
he wants to learn enough of the language to tidy up their packages.

Derived constraints:

- Learners understand loops, conditionals, writing and calling functions, lists, and dictionaries,
  can load and use libraries,
  and can use classes and objects,
  but do not know how to create new classes
  or how to use higher-order functions.
- Learners understand mean, variation, correlation, and other basic statistical concepts,
  but are not familiar with statistical tests.
- Learners are comfortable creating and interpreting plots of various kinds.
- Learners have experience with spreadsheets and with writing database queries that use filtering, aggregation, and joins,
  but have not designed database schemas.
- Learners have no experience building web applications
  and are not familiar with version control systems or unit testing.
- Learners know how to use a text editor
  but have never used an IDE.
- Learners are willing to spend half an hour on the basics of the language,
  both because they understand the utility and as a safety blanket,
  but will then be impatient to start tackling real tasks.

## Learners' Questions

- What are R's basic data types and how do they compare to Python's?
- How do conditionals and loops work in R compared to Python?
- How do indexing and attribute access work in R?
- How do I create functions and libraries?
- How do I find and install libraries and get help on them?
- How do I process text with regular expressions?
- How do I store and manipulate tabular data?
- How do I load a tabular dataset and calculate simple statistics for each column?
- How do I filter, aggregate, and join datasets?
- How do I create plots?
- How do I write readable programs in R?

## Exercises

### Warming Up

These exercises will familiarize you with some of the core features of R.
Do all of the work interactively in RStudio until told to do otherwise.

1.  Create a vector `small` containing the numbers 1 to 5.
2.  Use it to create another vector `large` containing numbers ten times as large.
3.  Use these two vectors to create a third vector `combined` with the sum of the two vectors.
4.  Assign the average and standard deviation of `combined` to `combined_ave` and `combined_std`.
5.  Create a vector `shifted` by subtracting the mean of `combined` from each value of `combined`.
6.  Create a logical vector `mask` showing where values of `shifted` are within one standard deviation of zero.
7.  Increase the magnitude of the values in `shifted` that are within one standard deviation of zero by 10%.
8.  Write a function `fiddle` that takes a non-empty numeric vector as input and performs Steps 2-7 above.
9.  Save your function in a file called `fiddle.R`.
10. Restart RStudio, load the saved function `fiddle`, and apply it to a vector containing the numbers 3 to 7.
11. Apply `fiddle` to an empty vector.
12. Modify the saved version of `fiddle` so that it returns `NULL` if its input is not a non-empty numeric vector.
13. Test your changes by giving `fiddle` a vector with the strings ("3", "4", "5", "6", "7").

### Selecting, Filtering, and Aggregating Data

Read the CSV data set `infant_hiv/solution/infant-hiv.csv` into a tibble.
Use tidyverse functions to answer the following questions:

1. How many distinct countries are in the data?
1. Which countries reported an estimate for 2009?
1. Which countries reported an estimate for every year from 2009 to 2017?
1. What were the average estimates for 2014, 2015, and 2016?
1. How many countries didn't report estimates for one or more years?
1. Which countries never reported a low figure less than 50%?
1. Which countries reported a low figure greater than or equal to the estimate, and in which year(s)?

### Tidying Data

Look at the CSV file `infant_hiv/raw/infant-hiv.csv`
(which are taken from the Excel spreadsheet located in the same directory).
Write an R script that tidies this data and store the results in `infant_hiv/tidy/infant-hiv.csv`.
Compare your result to the file used in previous exercises.

### Making Reusable Code

Look at the three CSV files `maternal_health/raw/*.csv`
(which are taken from the Excel spreadsheet located in the same directory).
Using your solution to the previous exercise as a starting point,
write some helper functions to help you tidy up CSV files that are formatted this way,
and then use those functions in an R script that tidies these three files
and stores the results in `maternal_health/tidy/*.csv`.

### Combining Data

Using the tidied `maternal_health` data files from the previous exercise,
create and save a single tidy data set that has fraction of birth at health facilities,
fraction that have skilled attendants present,
and fraction of Caesarean sections
by country and year.

### Plotting

Using the combined data set created in the previous exercise,
create a scatter plot showing the relationship in each country
between the fraction of births at health facilities
and the fraction that have skilled attendants present,
coloring points according to the fraction of Caesarean sections.
